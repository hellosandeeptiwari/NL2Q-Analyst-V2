## Date: October 5, 2025

**Symptoms:**
- Button text overlapping
- No proper spacing between buttons
- Buttons appearing compressed
- CSS properties not properly applied

---

## ✅ CSS Fixes Applied

### 1. **Chat Header Container**
```css
.chat-header {
  padding: 16px 24px;
  border-bottom: 1px solid #e2e8f0;
  background: white;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
  min-height: 72px;          /* ✅ NEW: Ensures consistent height */
  flex-shrink: 0;            /* ✅ NEW: Prevents header from shrinking */
  gap: 24px;                 /* ✅ INCREASED: from 16px to 24px */
  position: relative;        /* ✅ NEW: For absolute positioning context */
}
```

**Changes:**
- Added `min-height: 72px` - ensures header doesn't collapse
- Added `flex-shrink: 0` - prevents flexbox from shrinking the header
- Increased `gap` from 16px to 24px - more breathing room between left and right sections
- Added `position: relative` - provides positioning context

---

### 2. **Header Left Section**
```css
.header-left {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  gap: 16px;
  flex: 0 1 auto;           /* ✅ CHANGED: from flex: 1 to flex: 0 1 auto */
  min-width: 0;
  max-width: 60%;           /* ✅ NEW: Prevents left section from taking too much space */
}
```

**Changes:**
- Changed `flex: 1` to `flex: 0 1 auto` - prevents left section from taking all available space
- Added `max-width: 60%` - ensures right buttons always have space

---

### 3. **Database Status Indicator**
```css
.database-status-indicator {
  display: inline-flex;           /* ✅ CHANGED: from flex to inline-flex */
  align-items: center;
  gap: 6px;
  padding: 6px 12px;
  background: #f0fdf4;            /* ✅ CHANGED: Better green background */
  border: 1px solid #bbf7d0;      /* ✅ CHANGED: Matching border */
  border-radius: 20px;
  font-size: 11px;
  font-weight: 500;
  white-space: nowrap;
  flex-shrink: 0;
  transition: all 0.2s ease;
  color: #166534;                 /* ✅ CHANGED: Dark green text */
  max-width: 300px;               /* ✅ NEW: Prevents overflow */
  overflow: hidden;               /* ✅ NEW: Hides overflow text */
  text-overflow: ellipsis;        /* ✅ NEW: Shows ... for long text */
}
```

**Changes:**
- Changed to `inline-flex` for better inline behavior
- Better color scheme (green theme for "connected" status)
- Added max-width and overflow handling for long database names

### 4. **Chat Actions Container** 🎯
```css
.chat-actions {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  gap: 12px;                  /* ✅ INCREASED: from 8px to 12px */
  flex-wrap: nowrap;
  flex-shrink: 0;
  margin-left: auto;          /* ✅ NEW: Pushes buttons to the right */
}
```

**Changes:**
- Increased `gap` from 8px to 12px - more space between buttons
- Added `margin-left: auto` - ensures buttons stay on the right side

---

### 5. **Action Buttons** 🎯🎯🎯
```css
.action-btn {
  padding: 8px 16px;              /* ✅ INCREASED: from 6px 12px to 8px 16px */
  border: 1px solid #d1d5db;
  background: white;
  border-radius: 8px;             /* ✅ INCREASED: from 6px to 8px */
  font-size: 13px;                /* ✅ INCREASED: from 12px to 13px */
  font-weight: 500;
  cursor: pointer;
  transition: all 0.2s;
  display: inline-flex;           /* ✅ CHANGED: from flex to inline-flex */
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;        /* ✅ NEW: Centers content */
  gap: 8px;                       /* ✅ INCREASED: from 6px to 8px */
  white-space: nowrap;
  flex-shrink: 0;
  color: #374151;
  min-width: fit-content;         /* ✅ NEW: Ensures button fits content */
  line-height: 1.2;               /* ✅ NEW: Consistent text line height */
  height: 36px;                   /* ✅ NEW: Fixed height for consistency */
}
```

**Key Changes:**
- **Increased padding** from `6px 12px` to `8px 16px` - buttons are less cramped
- **Increased border-radius** from 6px to 8px - more modern look
- **Increased font-size** from 12px to 13px - better readability
- **Changed to inline-flex** - better button behavior
- **Added justify-content: center** - centers icon and text
- **Increased gap** from 6px to 8px - more space between icon and text
- **Added min-width: fit-content** - ensures button never shrinks smaller than content
- **Added height: 36px** - consistent button height
- **Added line-height: 1.2** - prevents text from being cut off
